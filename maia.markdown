MAIA is a computational platform developed by Simone Bendazzoli in our group. 

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into clinical workflows requires robust collaborative platforms that are able to bridge the gap between technical innovation and practical healthcare applications. Simone Bendazzoli (PhD) has developed MAIA (Medical Artificial Intelligence Assistant), an open-source platform designed to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and AI developers. Built on Kubernetes, MAIA offers a modular, scalable environment with integrated tools for data management, model development, annotation, deployment, and clinical feedback. Key features include project isolation, CI/CD automation, integration with high-computing infrastructures and in clinical workflows. MAIA supports real-world use cases in medical imaging AI, with deployments in both academic and clinical environments. By promoting collaborations and interoperability, MAIA aims to accelerate the translation of AI research into impactful clinical solutions while promoting reproducibility, transparency, and user-centered design. The platform is open-sourced here: <https://github.com/kthcloud/MAIA>
